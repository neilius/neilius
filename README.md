HI! I'm Neil. I'm a software developer currently living in Chicago, Illinois. I primarily work in web development, specializing in a number of programming languages including Python, PHP and Javascript.

Outside of programming, my passions are music, soccer, history, and games of all types.

I currently work with the application frameworks team at Cond√© Nast.
