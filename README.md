HI! I'm Neil. I'm a software developer currently living in Chicago, Illinois. I primarily work in web development, specializing in a number of programming languages including Python, Javascript, and PHP.

Outside of programming, my passions are music, soccer, history, and games of all types.

I currently work as an engineer at Genius.
